Arbitrage trading & Portfolio management

A cryptocurrency portfolio management system that lets you store all the coins you have invested in and pulls data from end points such as Koinex, etc to constantly keep you updated about the current price of the coins you have. The idea was to facilitate Arbitrage trading in the sense that prices differ in different market places and one can buy it from one market and sell it in another and earn on the difference both the markets had. The app also had a chat bot to notify you of the price change. It had an inbuilt email inbox system, a todo feature, ability to integrate payment gateways, etc.
